When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I'm working with someone on a project, I use more devices or I have to travel but I can't bring my computer
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I don't want my incorreect commits to be on GitHub
